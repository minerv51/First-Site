            <h3>ITM 780</h3>
            <h4>My Most Useful Course</h4>
            <p>ITM 780 or Web Design & Management is a course that gives 
            students an introduction to all of the components of web 
            design and management, the final project is creating a 
            personal portfolio website.</p>
            <p>ITM 780 is my most useful course as I believe that knowing web design is crucial in today's society
                for a few reasons. Firstly, since I want to be an entrepreneur it is important that I can communicate enticing messages
                of different goods and services on todays most accessible form of media... the internet. If I am able to communicate products
                effectively I can sell them.
